- Social axioms are relatively stable over time and cannot easily be changed. Longitudinal studies have shown that social axioms exhibited a moderate to strong stability over a one-year period (rs ranged from 0.39 to 0.62; Li, Tong, Tao, Zhang, & Wu, 2020).

Introduction: Provide some background information on the topic and the purpose of your task. State your main argument or research question and how you will address it. Mention the journal name, its main audience, and the type of paper you are analyzing.

The paper is titled “Testing the Associations among Social Axioms, School Belonging, and Flourishing among Chinese Secondary School Students: A Longitudinal Study” by Yuen-Lam Cheung and Daniel T.L. Shek1.
The paper is published in Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being, which is a peer-reviewed journal that aims to promote health and well-being through psychological theory and research2. The main audience of the journal is researchers, practitioners, and policy makers who are interested in applied psychology topics related to health and well-being2.
The paper is an empirical research paper that uses a longitudinal design to investigate how social axioms (generalised social beliefs) affect students’ well-being and sense of belonging at school over time1. The paper addresses both academic and practical audiences by providing theoretical insights into social axioms theory and empirical evidence for its applicability in educational settings1.
Description: Summarize the main points of the literature review section of the paper. Identify the sources used by the author(s) and how they are categorized (e.g., primary, secondary, tertiary; empirical, theoretical; chronological, thematic; etc.). Explain how the sources relate to each other and to the research question or argument of the paper. Describe how the author(s) present their data and methodology.

The literature review section consists of three subsections: introduction, topic literature review, and data and methodology1.
In the introduction subsection, the author(s) provide an overview of social axioms theory (SAT), which proposes that people hold generalised social beliefs that guide their behavior in different situations1. They cite several primary sources (original studies or reports) that introduce SAT (e.g., Leung et al., 2002; Bond et al., 2004) or apply it to different cultural contexts (e.g., Cheng et al., 2013; Cheung et al., 2016)1. They also cite some secondary sources (reviews or summaries of existing literature) that synthesize previous findings on SAT (e.g., Leung & Bond, 2004; Bond & Lun, 2014)1. They use these sources to establish SAT as a valid and useful framework for understanding human behavior across cultures1.
In the topic literature review subsection, they focus on two specific aspects of SAT: its temporal stability (how consistent it is over time) and its effects on individuals’ flourishing (a measure of well-being)1. They cite mostly primary sources that report empirical studies on these aspects using different samples (e.g., students, adults), methods (e.g., cross-sectional, longitudinal), measures (e.g., Social Axioms Survey, Flourishing Scale), variables (e.g., demographics, personality), outcomes (e.g., life satisfaction, mental health)1. They use these sources to identify gaps or inconsistencies in existing literature, such as lack of longitudinal studies on SAT among students, mixed findings on whether SAT predicts flourishing directly or indirectly through other factors, limited attention to potential mediators or moderators between SAT flourishing1.
In the data and methodology subsection, they describe their own study design, sample, measures, and data analysis procedures1. They cite some primary sources that validate their measures (e.g., Diener et al., 2010; Cheung & Leung,

or support their analytical methods (e.g., Little et al., 2007; Hayes, 2018)[1-].

Based on the web search results, a literature review is a part of an academic paper that summarizes and evaluates the existing literature on a specific topic or question. A literature review should have three main elements: an introduction, a body, and a conclusion123.

The introduction should provide an overview of the subject, issue or theory under consideration, along with the objectives and scope of the literature review2. It should also establish the context and relevance of the topic and explain why it is important to review the literature.

The body should organize and discuss the sources according to themes, categories or trends12. It should compare and contrast different perspectives, methods, findings and arguments of the sources and identify gaps, inconsistencies or controversies in the literature. It should also show how each source relates to your research question or thesis statement.

The conclusion should summarize the main findings and implications of the literature review1. It should also identify limitations or challenges of the existing literature and suggest directions for future research or practice.

In this article, I found that:

The introduction briefly introduces social axioms as generalised social beliefs that influence well-being outcomes. It also states that this study aims to examine their temporal stability and prospective effects on flourishing among university students. However, it does not clearly explain why this topic is significant or relevant for psychology research.
The body reviews previous studies on social axioms and their relations with subjective well-being (SWB) and flourishing. It also discusses some potential mediators such as school belonging that may link social axioms with flourishing. However, it does not provide a clear structure or organization of the sources according to themes or categories. It also does not critically evaluate or compare different sources or identify any gaps or controversies in the literature.
The conclusion sumarizes some key findings from previous studies on social axioms and flourishing. It also states some hypotheses for this study based on these findings. However, it does not synthesize or integrate different sources or highlight any implications or limitations of the literature review.
Therefore, I would say that this article’s literature review has some strengths but also some weaknesses. It provides some background information on social axioms and their associations with well-being outcomes but it lacks a clear structure, context and analysis of the existing literature.

here is the introduction of a journal's aims and scope: Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being is a peer-reviewed outlet for the scholarly dissemination of scientific findings and practical applications in the domains of health and well-being. Articles are encouraged from all areas of applied psychology including clinical, health, counseling, educational, sport, cross-cultural and environmental psychology. The mission of the journal is to provide readers with outstanding articles that present the latest data and best practices in the application of psychology to the promotion of well-being and optimal functioning.

Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being will publish empirical work, theoretical papers, model intervention programs, case studies, debates, and reviews. Of particular interest are intervention studies (e.g., randomized  controlled trials) and meta-analytic reviews.

here is an abstract of an article published in this journal: Background
This longitudinal study investigated the temporal stability of social axioms, which are generalised social beliefs, and tested their prospective effects on individuals' flourishing, among students, as well as the extent to which they can be potentially mediated by perceived sense of belonging at school.

Methods
Participants were 195 Chinese university students, who voluntarily completed a questionnaire measuring social axioms (at baseline, 1-year follow-up, and 2-year follow-up studies), school belonging (at 1-year follow-up study), and flourishing (at baseline and 2-year follow-up studies).

Results
Results showed supportive evidence for five types of social axioms being generally stable across these time intervals. After controlling for baseline flourishing, high baseline social cynicism significantly predicted a lower level of follow-up flourishing, whereas high baseline reward for application predicted a higher level of follow-up flourishing. Furthermore, higher levels of social cynicism predicted lower levels of school belonging, and the latter partially mediated the effect of social cynicism on follow-up flourishing.

Conclusions
All social axioms are relatively stable across time. Social cynicism, reward for applications, and school belonging are the most salient predictors for flourishing among Chinese university students.
